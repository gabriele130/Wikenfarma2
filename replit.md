## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system variables
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with a clear separation between UI components, pages, and business logic. The design system uses CSS variables for theming and provides both light and dark mode support.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API endpoints
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Replit-based OAuth with session management
- **File Structure**: Monolithic structure with separate client/server/shared directories

The backend implements a RESTful API pattern with middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling. The shared directory contains common schemas and types used by both frontend and backend.

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Key Entities**:
  - Users (authentication and roles)
  - Customers (private, pharmacy, wholesaler, doctor types)
  - Products (inventory management)
  - Orders and OrderItems (multi-type order processing)
  - Shipments (delivery tracking)
  - Commissions (ISF and sales tracking)
  - Integrations (external service status)
  - Activity Logs (audit trail)

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit OAuth integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session store
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags
- **User Roles**: Role-based access control (user, admin, manager)

The authentication system integrates with Replit's OAuth service and maintains user sessions in the database for scalability and persistence.

### API Architecture
- **Pattern**: RESTful API with consistent error handling
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation
- **Middleware**: Request logging, authentication checks, and error handling
- **File Uploads**: Integration with Google Cloud Storage and Uppy

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting with serverless architecture
- **Replit Authentication**: OAuth provider for user management
- **Google Cloud Storage**: File and document storage

### Planned Integrations
The system is designed to integrate with multiple external services:

- **Gestline**: ERP system integration
- **Odoo**: Business management suite
- **GLS**: Shipping and logistics provider
- **PharmaEVO**: Pharmaceutical industry-specific system
- **Email Services**: Newsletter and communication automation
- **WhatsApp**: Customer communication channel

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with ESBuild for production builds
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier (implied from standard setup)
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and runtime error overlay

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Icons**: Font Awesome integration
- **File Upload**: Uppy with AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage adapters
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing

The architecture prioritizes modularity, type safety, and integration capabilities to support the complex workflow requirements of pharmaceutical business operations.
